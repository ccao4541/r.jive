Description: Performs the JIVE decompositions on a list of data sets when the data share a dimension, returning low-rank matrices that capture the joint and individual structure of the data. It provides two methods of rank selection when the rank is unknown, a permutation test and a BIC selection algorithm. Also included in the package are three plotting functions for visualizing the variance attributed to each data source: a bar plot that shows the percentages of the variability attributable to joint and individual structure, a heatmap that shows the structure of the variability, and principal component plots.
